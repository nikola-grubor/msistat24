## Parametric and non-parametric tests {.smaller}

:::: columns

::: {.column}

- Tests comparing arithmetic means assume a normal distribution
- The normal distribution is defined by [parameters]{.yellow}: mean and standard deviation
- Tests that do not rely on distributions are called [non-parametric]{.yellow}

```{r}
#| fig-asp: 1
p1 <- ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(-5, 5)), aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 101, args = list(mean = 0, sd = 1),

## A recipe for testing the null hypothesis

1. Form a [hypothesis]{.yellow} before seeing the data
2. Determine the null and alternative hypothesis
3. Collect *relevant* data
4. Create a model that represents the data and calculate the [test statistic]{.yellow}
5. Calculate the probability that our data gives the obtained test statistic if the null is true
6. Assess "statistical significance"

## Why use ranks?

:::: columns

::: {.column}

- Fewer assumptions are better
- Normality rarely holds
- When assumptions are violated, obtained p-values are wrong

::: {.callout-important}

We lose statistical power if the data actually meet the conditions for a parametric (eg., Student's) test

## Mann-Whitney U / Wilcoxon rank-sum test

![](slike/sumrank.png){fig-align="center"}

## Assumptions of the rank sum test

Input:

- Numerical non-normal data, ordinal data

Assumptions:

- The sample consists of independent observations
- Data can be ranked

::: {.callout-important}
It has less statistical power than parametric tests, if the conditions for parametric tests are met.
:::

## Checking for normality

- [Coefficient of Variation]{.yellow}
- Skew and Kurtosis
- QQ Plot
- [Histogram]{.yellow}
- Statistical tests for normality

## Exercise: MWW test

::: {.r-fit-text}

Examine whether people with different

altitudes of residence

differ according to the concentration of fibrinogen.

## Wilcoxon signed rank test

Input:

- Numerical non-normal data, ordinal data

Assumptions:

- The sample consists of [dependent]{.yellow} observations
- Data can be ranked

## Exercise: Wilcoxon signed rank test

::: {.r-fit-text}

The database [Depresion.xlsx]{.yellow}

contains pre- and post treatment

depressive symptom measurements.

Did the treatment affect them?

:::

## Statistical test selection

- One or two samples
- Repeated measurements or not
- Data type (numeric, ordinal, categorical)
- Use data summaries to determine whether the data meet the normality assumption
